--Query to join pain and hourly_fft tables. Last is the one used.

-- Get a list of all pain score recording times and levels
-- For a given pain score time, find the relevant hourly_fft data
-- Compute the relevant stats for that time
-- Can first join both tables based on how they should be grouped
-- Save as table
